##Pneumonia Detection Using Deep Learning (CNN)
Project Overview
This project aims to detect pneumonia in chest X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). By leveraging deep learning techniques, we can assist in automating the diagnosis process, which can be valuable in clinical settings where fast and accurate results are essential.

Dataset
The model is trained on the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset, available on Kaggle, containing:

Normal cases: 1,583 images
Pneumonia cases: 4,273 images
Features
Data Preprocessing: Normalizes and augments images to enhance model robustness.
CNN Model: A convolutional neural network designed to differentiate pneumonia from normal cases.
Evaluation: Measures accuracy, precision, recall, and other metrics to assess model performance.
Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow, Keras
Other dependencies: numpy, matplotlib
