# pneumonia-detection-using-deep-learning
This repository contains a deep learning project for detecting pneumonia in chest X-ray images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Leveraging publicly available datasets, such as the Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle, this project implements a CNN model capable of distinguishing between pneumonia and normal cases.
